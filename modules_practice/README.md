## Difference Between CommonJS and ESM
CommonJS (CJS): Uses require() for importing modules and module.exports for exporting them. It executes modules synchronously, making it suitable for server-side applications.

ESM (ECMAScript Modules): Uses import and export statements, supporting asynchronous loading. ESM works in both browsers and modern Node.js environments.

## When to Use Each Module System
Use CommonJS when working with older Node.js projects, or when using dependencies that do not support ESM.
Use ESM for modern applications, particularly when targeting both browsers and Node.js, as it provides better performance and compatibility.

# Advantages and Disadvantages
 ## Advantages of CommonJS (CJS)
Widely Supported: CommonJS has been the default module system in Node.js for years, making it compatible with most existing Node.js projects.

Synchronous Execution: Since modules load synchronously, it simplifies execution in server-side environments where immediate availability of modules is preferred.

 ## Disadvantages of CommonJS (CJS)
No Tree Shaking: Since CJS exports are mutable and dynamic, bundlers cannot perform tree shaking, leading to potentially larger bundle sizes.

Limited Browser Support: CommonJS is not natively supported in browsers, requiring bundlers like Webpack or Browserify to work in front-end applications.

## Advantages of ECMAScript Modules (ESM)
Native Browser Support: ESM is supported in modern browsers without additional tooling, making it ideal for front-end applications.

Asynchronous Loading: Modules can be loaded asynchronously, improving performance, especially in large applications.

 ## Disadvantages of ECMAScript Modules (ESM)
Complex Migration: Older Node.js projects using CommonJS require refactoring to adopt ESM, which may not always be straightforward.

Different Configuration Requirements: Using ESM in Node.js requires setting "type": "module" in package.json or using the .mjs file extension, which can lead to compatibility issues.

## Handling Module Imports in Real-World Applications
For Node.js: Use ESM by setting "type": "module" in package.json or stick with CJS for legacy support.
For Browsers: Always use ESM, as modern browsers natively support import and export.

For Hybrid Projects: Use transpilers like Babel or tools like Webpack to ensure compatibility across environments.
